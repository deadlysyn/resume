### Objective

My primary objective in life is to have an impact... on my team, my community, and the world. Accomplishing that by delivering software and infrastructure solutions to real-world challenges while developing and using free and open-source software is my dream.

### About Me

I am a humble, collaborative, ambitious, and continuously improving DevOps engineer. I have been delivering large-scale distributed systems and mission critical infrastructure services for over two decades. In that time I have developed a wide range of experience which includes being an individual contributor, technical lead, architect and hands-on manager.

I am passionate about DevOps culture and SRE principles as ways to rally people with diverse backgrounds around shared outcomes; increasing productivity while simultaneously improving quality of life through tenacious pursuit of automation and elimination of toil.

I am familiar with multiple cloud infrastructure providers, including Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform, as well as multiple container orchestration frameworks including Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry. I am well versed in Agile/XP practices, Lean Product Development, and Infrastructure as Code.

I am pragmatic in both my work style and technology choices, seeing the world as a series of tradeoffs that must be carefully considered and occasionally reevaluated. I have worked fully remote for over a decade, am an excellent communicator, and highly effective at asynchronous collaboration. I value flexibility, autonomy and deep focus enabling a state of flow. I love Linux, Vim, Git and opportunities to solve new puzzles in a variety of languages.

### Guiding Principles

These quotes have always been near and dear to my heart:

- _Specialization is for insects._ -Robert A. Heinlein
- _We are all apprentices in a craft where no one ever becomes a master._ -Ernest Hemingway
- _The humblest tasks get beautified if loving hands do them._ -Louisa May Alcott
