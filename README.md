### Objective

My primary objective in life is to have an impact... on my team, my community,
and the world. Accomplishing that by delivering software and infrastructure
solutions to real-world challenges while developing and using Free and Open
Source Software is my dream.

### About Me

I am a humble, collaborative, ambitious, and continuously learning DevOps
(aka Infrastructure, Cloud, Reliability engineer) engineer. I have been
delivering large-scale distributed systems and mission-critical infrastructure
services for nearly three decades. In that time I have developed a wide range
of experience which includes being an individual contributor, technical lead,
architect and hands-on manager.

I am passionate about DevOps culture and SRE principles as ways to rally people
with diverse backgrounds around shared outcomes; increasing productivity while
simultaneously improving quality of life through the tenacious pursuit of
automation and elimination of toil.

I am familiar with multiple cloud infrastructure providers, including Amazon
Web Services and Google Cloud Platform, as well as multiple container
orchestration frameworks including Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry. I am well
versed in Agile practices, Lean Product Development, and Infrastructure as Code.

I am pragmatic in both my work style and technology choices, seeing the world
as a series of trade-offs that must be carefully considered and occasionally
re-evaluated. I have worked fully remote for over a decade, am an excellent
communicator, and highly effective at asynchronous collaboration. I value
flexibility, autonomy and deep focus enabling a state of flow.
